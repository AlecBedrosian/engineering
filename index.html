 <h4>9/2/2022 <br> Today we worked on tinker cad more and and had a compition for the best cad I got 3rd place in my group</h4>
 <h4>9/16/2022 <br> This week we started our Rube Goldberg project. We also did a challenge where we had to make a boat using only paper and see how long the ship could float. Regarding the project, we cut out cardboard and made a ramp and a door for the project.</h4>
 <h4>9/23/2022 <br> This week we finished and tested our groups rube godlberg machines. Our Rube Goldberg machine had a slope, a trap door, a pulley, and a see saw with a needle at the end that pops the baloon. Our group one of the most complex machines out of our class. Over all this week was one of the best ones yet becasue we got to improve our machines, then test them.</h4>
<h4>9/30/2022  <br> This week we disected old laptops with our group so that we learned the internals of the laptop. Then when we were done we filled out a worksheet to prove we knew all that parts.</h4>
<h4>10/7/2022  <br> This week we watched a video about prostetics then we made prostetics on cad i made a prostetics rattle also on friday we did a challenge where we make a phsical code of how to make a pbj sandwich, some less specific codes failed, more specific codes succeded. This challenge was fun. </h4>
<h4>10/14/2022 <br> I was not here the day the class did the paper thing when we cadded the rocket we did it as a group.</h4>
<h4>10/21/2022 <br> This week we finished our rocket, we went outside by the feild by our class. Our team's rocket went up then to the right into me and my camera. It was pretty fun overall becasue we got to see how different rocket designes functioned. I think if our group made our rocket more for gliding, we would have done better.</h4>
<h4>10/27/2022 <br> This week we learned about environmental engineering, on thursday we did a challenge where we make a water filter out of a 2 liter coke bottle, cotton balls, sand, pebbles and medium sized rocks. we stacked these on each other and put dirty water in the filter, after 3 minutes we were one of the first groups to have clear water come out the bottom. This was fun activity becasue we got to see which types of rock patterns filter the best When we went back inside we did a challeng were we had to figure out how many candy corns could fit on a peice of 8x11" paper. Our group said 168 candy corns coud fit on the paper.</h4>
<h4>11/4/2022<br> This week we messed around with bread boards on tinker cad after learning about OHM's law..</h4>
<h4>11/10/2022<br>This week we actuay worked on bread boards and we played around with similar consepts that we expeirmented on tinker cad, nothing very intresting, expect getting to use a real breadboard.</h4>
<h4>11/18/2022<br>This week we coded a blinking loop on the Arduino website, then we hooked it up to our physical Arduino. On friday, we did a callenge where we had to find out if there were more wheels than doors on campus. Mr.Kim sent out half the class to count for doors and sent my half of the class to hunt for wheels. Dr.Neat let me in the robotics room and I got a lot of wheels from that In the end wheels won.</h4>
<h4>12/2/2022<br>I wasn't here that week but I heard that they cadded and glued spagetti our group chouse a long and skinny bridge that could possibly hold the weight of a bucket. We are going to test next week.</h4>
<h4>12/9/2022<br>This week we worked on and succesfully built our groups 1st spagetti bridge. We want to test it next week and start our second design. </h4>
<h4>12/15/2022<br>This Week we built our second and third bridge. Our second bridge had an x railroad pattern and held 1 1/2 cups. We are designing our third bridge with a X pattern to see which one is stronger.</h4>
<h4>12/20/2022<br>This Week we built our final iteration, It held 3 cups. This was our best one becasue of the middle support we added for the final. On a technecality we won

<h4>1/18/2023<br>It's a new year and this is what we started with How to make a lake nontoxic with ineexpensive black balls. Also we learned about a new project the mouse trap car so we had to make a project proposal which after the fact of doing that and making a car was way off.</h4>
<h4>1/20/2023<br>This week we made oobleck which is a mixture of starch and water. Oobleck can be a liquid or solid depending on how you use it. The ratio is 2 starch to one water. When you apply hard and fast force, Oobleck becasomes a solid. But it was messy</h4>
<h4>1/27/2023<br>We made cad's of our cars. this is after we made the car there were so many things we didn't put on the car.</h4>
<h4>2/3/2023<br>This week we finished our cad, then on Friday we played a game called Freeway on steam for four dollars. Its a game where you try to make the most efficient freeway layout so that cars can flow through traffic. This is Armand and I in the process of creatin one of our most efficient freeways yet. image down below.</h4>
<h4>2/10/2023<br>We made most of our car with the body and axles out of dowles and cardboard</h4>
<h4>2/17/2023<br>We finished our car but and it worked better than the second idderation but we took it apart before a picture i can put what we have left of it.</h4>
<h4>2/24/2023<br>we started on the second idderation which took faster to make we finished everything expect the wheels it was made up of styrofome and reinforsced with dowles</h4>
<h4>3/3/2023<br> we finished it sucked but it kind of worked with help. the first one was better</h4>
<h4>3/10/2023<br> We made a small boat out of a cup for our challenge day but we messed it up it was too tall and wide so it didnt go far.</h4>
<h4>3/24/23 <br> This week we started a project were we drop an egg and try not to crack it. So far all groups including mine have made a cad for our design. The Design will be at the bottom</h4>
<h4>3/31/23<br>This week we focused on building a exoskeleton for an egg that we would drop 3 stories. Our design was good becasuse it was very simple and easy but good becasue the egg survived. We put an egg in a baloon, then put newspaper in the baloon to create a cushion. Then we built a triangular cage out of straws, we then put the egg inside and attached the trash bag. Our design can be seen below.</h4>
<h4>4/10/2023<br> Now for ower final we are making a cardboard boat made with cardboard and one roll duct tape we are making a canoo style and Sebatian and I are going across the pool in it. </h4>
